# Puppet Support Policies

Puppet's GitHub namespace contains many repositories for a great variety of types of projects,
each with different levels of support. This document isn't intended to be a definitive resource
explaining each level. Instead, it will link to the full support policy for each. Please refer
to our [support services page](https://puppet.com/support-services) for more information on
professional services, training, or certification. You're also invited to participate in our
[vibrant and engaging community](https://puppet.com/community).


## Products with support contracts

With your support contract for any of Puppetâ€™s products, you are eligible for help from our
team of expert support engineers. The support benefit includes access to new product releases,
bug fixes, an authenticated support portal and knowledge base.
[Learn more](https://puppet.com/support-services/customer-support).


## Puppet maintained Open Source Projects

Our Open Source projects have no explicit support policy. If you have a support contract and
you're using an Open Source project along with your supported product, then you'll receive
best-effort assistance if you make a support request.

You are invited to file issues on the project, or to contribute pull requests correcting the
problem you're running into. That process will vary depending on the project. If GitHub issues
are not enabled, then you'll need to file tickets in the appropriate [JIRA project](https://tickets.puppet.com).

The [Puppet Community Slack](https://slack.puppet.com) is a great way to get peer-to-peer help.
You'll even find many Puppet engineers participating in conversations there.

## Modules

Many Puppet modules in this namespace were created by individuals solving a specific problem.
The Forge Modules team will maintain and correct issues with modules in the Puppet namespace, but
does not offer specific support for most modules. If you have a support contract, then the 
Support team will attempt best-effort assistance.

The [Puppet Community Slack](https://slack.puppet.com) is a great way to get peer-to-peer help
from people using these modules. You'll also find that the Forge Modules team is often available
for questions in the `#forge-modules` channel.

### Supported Modules

Puppet Forge modules are meant to make your life easier. Puppet Supported modules take
it one step further, making sure common services are easy to set up, implement, and manage with
Puppet Enterprise. Puppet guarantees that each supported module has been tested with Puppet Enterprise,
is subject to official Puppet Enterprise support, is maintained, and compatible with multiple platforms.
 See the [support policy](https://forge.puppet.com/supported) on the Forge for more details.

### Partner Supported Modules

Support for these modules is provided by a Puppet partner. In some cases, this may require a
support contract with the partner vendor.

### Approved Modules

With the new Puppet Approved program, finding the right module is even easier. Puppet Approved
modules are recommended by Puppet for use with Puppet Enterprise and meet our expectations for
quality and usability. [Learn more](https://forge.puppet.com/approved) on the Forge.

## All other repositories

Some repositories in this namespace are personal or department "pet projects". They have no
support implied whatsoever, although the developers might offer their own support expectations.
